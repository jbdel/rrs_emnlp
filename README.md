`preprocess_mimic_iii.ipynb` will download, preprocess and split the data as used in our experiments. You'll need a physionet account.
`chest_ct_evaluation.ipynb` will evaluate the output of our system on CHEST CT on the metrics presented in the paper. 

To not violate the double blind review process, we do not release the training code for now.
